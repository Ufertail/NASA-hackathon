                    <p>It have gone through a lot with this life. In the very beginning, it was a fiery rock with a surface dotted with volcanoes, and later a “snowball” when Earth’s surface was buried beneath a vast layer of ice and permafrost. 4. Though it was a struggle for Earth to endure, it nonetheless withstood these challenges, allowing life to persist.</p>

                    <p>There was something strange about her atmosphere, she noticed human, brittle creatures that invested resources in their heads, now making her, celestial body, uncomfortable. Numerous factories, whose emissions surpassed the natural regulators of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, laid the groundwork for an unforeseen and dreadful future.</p>

                    <p><br> Life is precious, and Earth couldn’t stand the thought of losing it, unfortunately she is not in control of her atmosphere. “With this tempo, they will be dead in near 200 years” - though earth, - “Why can’t they reduce the emissions just a little bit! It’s about their life, not mine! I don’t want this to happen again..”</p>

                    <p><br> Earth was frustrated, humans led by unwise leaders marching straight into their deaths just to gain more valuable papers, although there were some people that opposed this. There were different types of eco activists, some like Greta Tumberg who prefer to take active action and directly influence society or some like David Attemboro preferring to change culture itself making films that opens Earth beaty. Despite their effort, greediness wins, and death walk continues, Yet it appears as though people are content with the situation, willingly dancing to the tune played by their rulers.</p>

                    <p><br> Fortunately, people still have time to change their fate of soon inevitable death. Only if every person on Earth awakens and takes steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can true change unfold. Every individual’s actions carry weight, and we must not obscure our significance with the shadows of learned helplessness. Act now.</p>
